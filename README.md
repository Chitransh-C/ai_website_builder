**AI Website Builder üöÄ**
A powerful, AI-driven tool that generates and refines web components in real-time. Built with Next.js and the Google Gemini API, this application allows users to go from a simple text prompt to a fully functional, styled, and interactive web component with just a few clicks.

‚ú® Key Features
1)  This project is a feature-rich Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases a wide range of modern web development and AI      integration techniques:

2)  AI Code Generation: Leverages the Google Gemini API to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from natural language prompts.

3)  Live Preview: Instantly renders the generated code in a secure, sandboxed <iframe> for immediate visual feedback.

4)  Interactive Element Inspector: A "Developer Mode" that allows users to hover over and select any element in the live          preview to see its specific code.

5)  Iterative Refinement: Users can select a generated element and provide follow-up instructions (e.g., "make this button        green") to the AI, which then refines just that part of the code.

6)  External Library Support: The AI can intelligently detect when a prompt requires an external library (like Chart.js,          GSAP, or Leaflet.js) and automatically include the necessary CDN links for both JS and CSS.

7) Conversational AI Chatbot: A floating chatbot that maintains conversation history, allowing users to ask follow-up            questions to understand the generated code.

8)  Session History: Automatically saves all generated components in a session history, allowing users to revisit and switch      between their past creations.

**Polished UI:**

Dark/Light Mode: A theme switcher for user comfort.

Collapsible Sidebar: A responsive history panel that can be collapsed to maximize workspace.

Utility Features: Includes "Copy to Clipboard" for each code block and a fullscreen "Focus Mode" for the preview.
